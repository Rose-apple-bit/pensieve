* PenSieve - A filesystem abstraction for prompting Large Language Models

The idea with =PenSieve= is that you drag and
drop files representing thoughts, or similarly
high-dimensional concepts, which are used to
prompt an imaginary filesystem.

What goes in also affects what comes out, and may be used to train the model.

A filesystem abstraction for prompting, using =Pen.el= as the prompting server.
