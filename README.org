* PenSieve - A filesystem interface to large language models

https://semiosis.github.io/pensieve/

The idea with PenSieve is that you drag and drop files representing thoughts.

What goes in also affects what comes out, and may be used to train the model.

A filesystem abstraction for prompting, using =Pen.el= as the prompting server.
