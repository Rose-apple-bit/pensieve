* PenSieve - A file system abstraction for prompting Large Language Models

PenSieve is a file system abstraction for an
imaginary file system based on prompting a
Large Language Models, using =Pen.el= as the
prompting server.

In layman's terms, you drag and drop files
representing thoughts, or similarly high-
dimensional entities.

You could, for example, drag memories between
chatbots, and that would influence each of
their personalities.

File system units such as files and directories
may also keep metadata, such as a prompting
history, which is used to guide the prompting.

What goes in also affects what comes out, and
may be used to train the model.
