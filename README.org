* =PenSieve= - A file system abstraction for prompting Large Language Models

=PenSieve= is essentially an imaginary file
system based on prompting Large LMs, using
=Pen.el= as the prompting server, or more accurately, a file system interface to prompting.

In layman's terms, you drag and drop files
representing thoughts, or similarly high-
dimensional entities.

You could, for example, drag memories between
chatbots, and that would influence each of
their personalities.

File system units such as files and directories
may also keep metadata, such as a prompting
history, which is used to guide the prompting.

What goes in also affects what comes out, and
may be used to train the model.
