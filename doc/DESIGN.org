* Design
** Simple mapping to Pen.el
I want _emergent behaviour_.

** Prompting
*** Initiate the filesystem like so
**** A chatbot's memories
#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  pensieve "Dumbledore's Memories"
#+END_SRC

**** The memories of people
#+BEGIN_SRC sh -n :sps bash :async :results none
  pensieve "People's memories"
#+END_SRC

*** Each directory has a prompt memory
I should tie a prompt function to each directory?
Allow to keep individual memory banks.

Make this an argument to the prompt functions.

*** The prompt
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  This is the filesystem for exploring <what>:
#+END_SRC
